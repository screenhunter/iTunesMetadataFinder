when you add music to itunes

it doesnt necessaryily have the right information (artist, lyrics, album, album artist, year composer etc)

what my program does is parse the mp3 file and use the given information to find it on the itunes store and then copy that data over

and if it cant find it you manually provide the itunes id and then it will pull the data for you

however, right now the code is very disorganized tho (think hw 1 from cs 1331)

my goal is to make more like hw 6 (where everything has a logical place)

and then add more features, and eventually a UI and everything
